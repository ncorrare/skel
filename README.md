## Overview

This is just a boilerplate module that includes testing and automatic deployment to the forge.

## Setup

### Setup Requirements **OPTIONAL**

You need to create (using travis encrypt, from the travis gem) to create the following secure environment variables:

- GITHUB_SECRET_TOKEN
- BLACKSMITH_FORGE_USERNAME
- BLACKSMITH_FORGE_PASSWORD

and set up USENETWORK to true and DEPLOY to true in order for deployment to work.

Remaining information is popuplated from Travis environment variables.
### Beginning with skel

Create a branch, and after doing a PR it will test and merge automatically if tests work. If DEPLOY is set to true it will tag, change metadata.json, commit, push, build and deploy to the forge

This is the living feature-test branch
